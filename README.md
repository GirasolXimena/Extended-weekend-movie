# Angular Extended Weekend Project  As a capstone to your AngularJS fullstack work, you'll be making a solo project in an extended weekend fashion.  You'll be flexing every code muscle you've built so far!  We've provided 3 projects for you to choose from. There is no code provided, save for a readme.  You will be making everything from scratch.   ## HOMEWORK (Wednesday)  - Read Project Options - Pick Project - Copy Trello Board - Create a repo (DO NOT CLONE/FORK)  ## Trello  1. Each Assignment contains a link to a premade Trello Board.  2. Please COPY it to your own account.  3. You should feel free to add or remove tasks from your own copy, but do not alter the original.  ## Project Options  - [Pet Hotel](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/pet-hotel-weekend-project) - [Time Tracker](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/time-tracker-project) - [Movie Collection](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/movie-collection-project)  ## HALP! I'M STUCK  When you run into an issue, we ask that you try to figure it out.   Steps: 1) Try Debugging (console logs or using a debugger tool), Reading Errors 2) Google a question 3) Ask a neighbor 4) Write your name on the queue (an instructor will help when available)  ## THE NEXT TWO SCHOOL DAYS  You will still be coming to school, 8:30am to 5pm. We will not have lectures, but we will have other events like speakers and speeches. **You will not have all day to work on code!**   ### Events (Subject to change!) - 1 on 1s - Speaker on Thursday - Speeches on Friday (What would you change about the Internet? 2-4 min) - MVP Standup 4pm Friday - Present completed project Monday
